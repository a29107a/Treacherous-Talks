    make release

This combines the files needed to build and install ejabberd
in rel/xmpp_frontend, with a makefile to install ejabberd
where it will be used. This can be re-run as needed, e.g.
when the xmpp_frontend directory is moved.

Config files in the config directory will be copied to
rel/xmpp_frontend for the installation step to install them.
