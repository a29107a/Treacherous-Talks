xmpp_frontend pre-release readme document
#########################################

This does NOT produce an OTP release. 

build (and make the release)
############################

    make release

This combines the files needed to build and install ejabberd
in rel/xmpp_frontend, with a makefile to install ejabberd
where it will be used. This can be re-run as needed, e.g.
when the xmpp_frontend directory is moved.

Config files in the config directory will be copied to
rel/xmpp_frontend for the installation step to install them.

development workflow
####################

One suggested workflow for development of component modules:

1. make release 
    make a release of the xmpp_frontend
2. cd rel/xmpp_frontend
3. make install
    make a local installation of ejabberd and our modules and configs
4. edit the modules e.g. ../../components/*.erl
5. cp ../../components/*.erl components/
    copy the component source here
6. make -B components
    rebuild the component source here
7. make install
    reinstall the components
8. ./installation/sbin/ejabberdctl live
    Run an interactive instance of ejabberd to see what's going on 
    while you test your modifications.

Yes, this is clunky. If you can improve on it, do so and inform 
people of the better workflow, here perhaps!
