Welcome to bench charts

* Overview
    Bench charts provides a quick way to look at the results generated by
    basho bench.

    It is currently specialized to work with the data generated from
    treacherous talks project.

* Quickstart

    - Copy generated csv files into the data folder
    - Update report.json with the csv file names
    - Update content.json with the graph details as necessary
    - Move / Start a HTTP server in the directory with index.html
        - Example: Use python simple HTTP server with the command
        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        #+END_EXAMPLE
        - Access http://localhost:8000

* TODO

    - Make it more generic to handle basho bench results in general
    - Cleanup custom.js
    - Performance considerations?
