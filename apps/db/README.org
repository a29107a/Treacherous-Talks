* DB
** Introduction
This project adapts the [[https://bitbucket.org/basho/wriaki/src][wriaki-riak-client]] for our project.
A few code changes have been made but they are really small.
** How to use this
make sure, that protobuffs, riakc, mochiweb and - of course - db
are included in your ./rebar.config and ./src/{{appid}}.app.src

If you need help, checkout the [[file:../db_user project][db_user]] which is nothing more
than a working app using db.
** I'm still like "???!?"
..ask/blame Stephan!
